## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

#### Permission Errors
A number of errors can be caused by scripts not having executable file
privileges. You can see the file permissions with `ls -l`, you should see
something like this:
```
$ ls -l clusterflow/modules/
total 608
-rwxrwxr-x 1 phil phil 6770 May 20 16:40 bismark_align.cfmod
-rwxrwxr-x 1 phil phil 4291 May 16 12:54 bismark_deduplicate.cfmod
-rwxrwxr-x 1 phil phil 2748 May 16 12:54 bismark_messy.cfmod
-rwxrwxr-x 1 phil phil 5652 May 16 12:54 bismark_methXtract.cfmod
-rwxrwxr-x 1 phil phil 3553 May 16 12:54 bismark_tidy.cfmod
-rwxrwxr-x 1 phil phil 7119 May 16 12:54 bowtie1.cfmod
```

This example is for the modules directory (all modules should have executable
privileges for all), the same applies to the main `cf` file.

#### DOS carriage returns
If you've edited any files, you may get problems due to windows-based editors
putting DOS-style `\r` carriage returns in.

Most linux environments come with a package called `dos2unix` which will
clean these up:
```
dos2unix *
```


### Errors from environment modules

#### ERROR:105: Unable to locate a modulefile for 'clusterflow'
This error probably means that Cluster Flow isn't installed in your
environment module system, and you're trying to run `module load clusterflow`

You can skip this step if you have another way of accessing the `cf` file,
or see the [Installation Instructions](installation/#environment_modules)
for details about how to set Cluster Flow up with environment modules.

### Errors from job submission

#### Unable to run job: job rejected: the requested parallel environment "orte" does not exist.
This message means that your GRIDEngine setup doesn't have the default
`orte` environment set up.  If you have different environments set up you
can list them with:
```
qconf -spl
```

You can get the details of any environment with:
```
qconf -sp [name]
```

If you find one which assigns slots to a single node (`allocation_rule`
should be `$fill_up`) then you can just do a find & replace for `orte`
to the name of your local environment and that should make things work again.

#### Unable to run job: job rejected (other reasons)
There may be other differences in the job submission requests that cause
them to fail. If you see errors such as this, you can use the
`@custom_job_submit_command` configuration variable to customise the way
that jobs are requested.
